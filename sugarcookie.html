		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<p>1 cup butter (room temperature)<br>
- 1 cup granulated sugar<br>
- 2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
- 1 egg<br>
- 3 cups flour<br>
- 2 tsp baking powder<br>
</p>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees<br>
2. Cream together butter and sugar by hand or in a mixer until combined<br>
3. Scrape sides of bowl and add in vanilla and egg. Mix until combined<br>
4. Add flour an baking powder to the bowl. Mix thoroughly until dough comes together. The dough should be a Playdoh texture. Add a little flour or water if needed to get the right consistency<br>
5. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll dough to a thickness of Â¼ inch (these cookies do not rise, and they will not get thinner)<br>
6. Use cookie cutters to cut out your desired shapes<br>
7. Transfer to a lined baking sheet<br>
8. Bake at 350 for 6-8 minutes, until the centers are puffy and no longer shiny. Remove the cookies from the oven before they start to brown<br>
9. Frost with your favorite icing and enjoy!
