		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<p>- Flour Tortillas<br>
		   - Vegetable Oil<br>
		   - Refried Beans<br>
		   - Browned Meat (ground beef, chicken, or turkey)<br>
		   - Shredded lettuce<br>
		   - Chopped tomatoes<br>
		   - Shredded cheese<br>
		   - Sour Cream<br>
		   - Salsa<br>
</p>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<p>1. Stab tortillas a few times with a sharp knife.<br>
           2. Heat up enough oil to comfortably cover the base of your pan to around 1/4" high. Around 1 cup should suffice depending on the size of your pan. You want the oil sizzling but not smoking.<br>
		      If you have a thermometer aim for between 340F - 350F.
           3. Use a pair of tongs to carefully slide the tortilla into the oil. Immediately grab your spatula and gently push down on the tortilla to flatten any bubbles and keep the tortilla under the oil.<br>
           4. After around 30-45 seconds (or until the bottom side starts to brown), use two spatulas to carefully flip the tortilla and fry for another 30-45 seconds.<br> 
		   5. Remove tortilla and rest on wire rack. They'll crisp as they cool. Again, just be vigilant because these will burn quickly. Better to remove them from the oil early than to leave them too long and burn.<br>
           6. Sprinkle both sides of the tortilla with a light pinch of salt.
		   7. Top with refried beans, browned meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, and salsa. Enjoy!</p>
