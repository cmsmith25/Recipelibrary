		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<p>- 4 4oz ground beef burger patties<br>
- ½ cup water (goes to the bottom of the pot to create steam)<br>
- Worchestershire Sauce<br>
- Burger seasoning<br>
- Foil or parchment paper<br>
<br>
</p>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<p>1. Start by adding Worchestershire sauce to beef and preparing the burger patties. Season each patty to taste.<br>
		2. Individually wrap each one of them in foil or parchment paper.<br>
3.	Place the patties wrapped in foil or parchment paper on the trivet in the IP, add ½ cup of water to the bottom of the pot. Cover with the lid.<br>
4.	Set the valve in sealing position, then click on manual – high pressure and cook for 10 minutes.<br>
5.	When the Instant Pot beeps and is done with cooking, do a quick release. Carefully open the lid away from your face, and take out the burger patties. If you want to brown the meat, just cook under the broiler for 2-3 minutes. Assemble the burgers with your favorite toppings and serve!
