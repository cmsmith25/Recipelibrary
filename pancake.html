		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<p>- 2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br>
- 1 Tbsp baking powder<br>
- 3/4 tsp salt<br>
- 1 1/2 cup milk<br>
- 2 large eggs<br>
- 4 Tbsp butter, melted<br>
- 1 tsp vanilla extract<br>
- cooking spray<br><br>
<b>Optional Toppings*</b><br>
•	fresh strawberries, sliced<br>
•	blueberries<br>
•	chocolate chips<br>
<br>
</p>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<p>1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.<br>
2.	In the same bowl, add in the milk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Whisk the wet ingredients together with the dry ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to over mix.<br>
3.	Generously coat a 11×17-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Pour the pancake batter onto the baking sheet. Spread the batter evenly around the baking sheet with a rubber spatula or tap the pan a few times on the counter to even out the batter.<br>
4.	Add any toppings that you’d like. Place the sheet pan in the oven and bake for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown.<br>
5.	Allow the pan to cool slightly, then slice the sheet pan pancake into 8 equal portions. Feel free to make smaller slices if you want to make more servings. Serve warm with syrup and extra toppings if you like. Enjoy!<br>
