		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<p>- 3 Tablespoons cornstarch, divided<br>
- 1 pound flank steak, cut into thin 1-inch pieces<br>
- 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce<br>
- 3 Tablespoons packed light brown sugar<br>
- 1 Tablespoon minced garlic<br>
- 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger<br>
- 2 Tablespoons vegetable oil, divided<br>
- 4 cups small broccoli florets<br>
- 1/2 cup sliced white onions<br>
- ½ cup carrots, cut into coins<br>
<br>
</p>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<p>1. In a large bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water. Add the beef to the bowl and toss to combine.<br>
2.	In a separate small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch with the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic and ginger. Set the sauce aside.<br>
3.	Heat a large nonstick sauté pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil and once it is hot, add the beef and cook, stirring constantly until the beef is almost cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a plate and set it aside.<br>
4.	Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the pan and once it is hot, add the broccoli florets, carrots and sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the broccoli is tender, about 4 minutes.<br>
5.	Return the beef to the pan then add the prepared sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until the sauce thickens slightly. Serve with rice or noodles.<br>
