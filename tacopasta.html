		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<p>- 1 cup Cheddar cheese, shredded<br>
- 1 cup Monterey Jack Cheese, shredded<br>
- 4 oz. Velveeta cheese, cut into cubes (equal to 1/3 cup)* can sub with ¾ cup shredded cheese<br>
- 1 lb. Ground Beef<br>
- 1 Tablespoon Butter<br>
- 2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
- 1 oz. packet Taco Seasoning<br>
- 1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br>
- 2 Tablespoons Tomato paste<br>
- 1 cup Beef broth<br>
- 1 cup Chicken broth<br>
- 1 cup Whole milk, at room temp<br>
- 1 (10 oz.) can Rotel Tomatoes with green chilies, undrained<br>
- ½ lb. Medium pasta shells<br>
</p>
		<h3>Directions:</h3>
		<p>1. Cook and crumble the ground beef over medium-high heat. Drain grease.<br>
2. 	Melt the butter in the same pot and add garlic. Cook for 1 minute.<br>
3. 	Add all remaining ingredients except the cheese and pasta. Stir to combine.<br>
4. 	Bring to a gentle boil. Add the pasta and submerge it in the liquid. Cover and cook according to package instructions. Be sure to stir to prevent any ingredients that may be settling to the bottom from sticking.<br>
5. 	Remove cover and ensure the pasta is sufficiently cooked. Taste-test a noodle for doneness before proceeding. If needed, cover and cook longer, until your desired doneness is obtained.<br>
6.	Turn heat to low. Gradually stir in cheese until melted.<br>
7.	There will be plenty of sauce but it will thicken upon standing and the pasta will continue to absorb it.<br>
8.	Serve once desired consistency is obtained.<br>
